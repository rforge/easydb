VERSION 0.7.6

    2014/09/29  Compiled for R 3.1.1

VERSION 0.7.2 

  2012/10/22 Work on a draft 'speedInsert' option for 
             'edbWrite.RODBC_MySQL', for fats bulk / multiple 
             rows insert.

VERSION 0.7.1

  2012/08/02 edbRead.RODBC_MySQL() now captures some errors 
             from (R)ODBC that were silently returned as a vector 
             of character strings.
  2012/08/02 .edbOperation.RODBC_MySQL() now uses on.exit() 
             instead of tryCatch() to close the database 
             (even when an error occur). This should make 
             error message clearer.

VERSION 0.7.0

  2012/08/01 'easyrodbcmysql' is now a package separated from 
             (but dependent on) 'easydb'. 'easydb' defines the 
             S3 Generic classes used by 'easyrodbcmysql'

VERSION 0.6.7 

  2012/08/01 RODBC Excel wasn't throwing an error when trying 
             to fetch a table that oes not exists, but edbRead 
             was hanging anyway later. Now edbRead stops with 
             the error message from ODBC.
  2012/08/01 edbRead.RODBC_Excel now suports table names without 
             a "$" suffix (added automatically if absent).
  2012/08/01 Added a readOnly argument to edbQuery.RODBC_Excel.

VERSION 0.6.5 

  2012/04/24 Internal modification of SQL query formulation 
             for row constrains: used 'IN' statement instead 
             of multiple 'OR' statements.
  2012/04/24 Added examples for edbQuery() and edbNRow() with 
             row constrains.
  2012/04/24 Added a check in the examples using RODBC for 
             Access and Excel, as it only works for 32-bits 
             systems (not on 64-bits).

VERSION 0.6.4 

  2012/03/08 added function and methods for edbQuery() 
  2012/03/08 Improved edbNRow() and edbDim() that were unefficient 
             on very large databases (now use SQL COUNT(*)) 
  2012/03/08 added hidden functions .edb.sRow() and .edb.sCol() 
             to format SQL code for rows and column selection 
             (now same code for all databases) 

VERSION 0.6.3

             not set)

             are supplied, and that they are in the correct order 
             (parano = TRUE)

  2011/11/26 Improved handling of POSIX and Date formats
  2011/11/26 Added argument to convert columns before writing them 
             or after reading them. Useful for writing and reading 
             dates to and from SQLite database (as integers)
