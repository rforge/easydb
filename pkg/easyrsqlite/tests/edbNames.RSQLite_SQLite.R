library( "easyrsqlite" ) 



### Make a copy of SQLite example database:
#   (a database of soil profile description) 
file.copy( 
    from = system.file( "soils.db", package = "easyrsqlite" ), 
    to   = "soils.db" 
)   

# soils.db is now in your working directory.



library( "RSQLite" ) # Because soils.db is a SQLite database...



### Describe the database (NB: this is not a connection)
myDb <- edb( dbType = "RSQLite_SQLite", dbName = "soils.db" ) 



### 3. Use the database:

# List the tables:
edbNames( myDb ) 



### Clean-up
file.remove( "soils.db" )
