VERSION 0.7.1

  2012/08/02 edbRead.RODBC_Access() now captures some errors 
             from (R)ODBC that were silently returned as a vector 
             of character strings.
  2012/08/02 .edbOperation.RODBC_Access() now uses on.exit() 
             instead of tryCatch() to close the database 
             (even when an error occur). This should make 
             error message clearer.

VERSION 0.7.0

  2012/08/01 'easyrodbcaccess' is now a package separated from 
             (but dependent on) 'easydb'. 'easydb' defines the 
             S3 Generic classes used by 'easyrodbcaccess'

VERSION 0.6.7 

  2012/08/01 RODBC Excel wasn't throwing an error when trying 
             to fetch a table that oes not exists, but edbRead 
             was hanging anyway later. Now edbRead stops with 
             the error message from ODBC.
  2012/08/01 edbRead.RODBC_Excel now suports table names without 
             a "$" suffix (added automatically if absent).
  2012/08/01 Added a readOnly argument to edbQuery.RODBC_Excel.

VERSION 0.6.5 

  2012/04/24 Internal modification of SQL query formulation 
             for row constrains: used 'IN' statement instead 
             of multiple 'OR' statements.
  2012/04/24 Added examples for edbQuery() and edbNRow() with 
             row constrains.
  2012/04/24 Added a check in the examples using RODBC for 
             Access and Excel, as it only works for 32-bits 
             systems (not on 64-bits).

VERSION 0.6.4 

  2012/03/08 added function and methods for edbQuery() 
  2012/03/08 Improved edbNRow() and edbDim() that were unefficient 
             on very large databases (now use SQL COUNT(*)) 
  2012/03/08 added hidden functions .edb.sRow() and .edb.sCol() 
             to format SQL code for rows and column selection 
             (now same code for all databases) 

VERSION 0.6.3 

  2011/01/20 fixed a bug in edbLog() (writing mode was sometimes 
             not set)

VERSION 0.6.2 

  2011/12/15 edbRead() supports SQL SELECT DISTINCT 
  2011/12/15 edbRead() supports SQL ORDER BY

  2011/12/14 edbWrite now checks that all expected columns 
             are supplied, and that they are in the correct order 
             (parano = TRUE)

VERSION 0.6.0 

  2011/12/13 MS Excel is now fully supported.

VERSION 0.5.x to 0.4.x

             and edbDrop.
  2011/11/26 Improved handling of POSIX and Date formats
  2011/11/26 Added argument to convert columns before writing them 
             or after reading them. Useful for writing and reading 
             dates to and from SQLite database (as integers) 

VERSION <= 0.3.x 

  2011/07/07 Added support for MS Access (via RODBC).
