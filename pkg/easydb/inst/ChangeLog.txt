VERSION 0.6.5 

  2012/04/24 Internal modification of SQL query formulation 
             for row constrains: used 'IN' statement instead 
             of multiple 'OR' statements.

             row constrains.
  2012/04/24 Added a check in the examples using RODBC for 
             Access and Excel, as it only works for 32-bits 
             systems (not on 64-bits).

  2012/03/08 added hidden functions .edb.sRow() and .edb.sCol() 
             to format SQL code for rows and column selection 
             (now same code for all databases)
