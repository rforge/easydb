\description{"[" method for reading all or part of a table in a SQLite 
database (referenced by 'edb'). Wrapper for 
\code{\link{edbRead.RSQLite_SQLite}}. }
\usage{
\method{[}{RSQLite_SQLite}(edb, tableName, sRow = NULL, sCol = NULL, sRowOp = c("AND", "OR")[1], formatCol = NULL, testFiles = TRUE, verbose = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{edb}{An object of class 'edb', such as returned by \code{\link{edb}}.}
  \item{tableName}{Single character string. Name of the table to read in 'edb'.}
  \item{sRow}{A list of named items. List of contrains/criterion to be applied 
on \code{tableName} to retrieve a subset of rows. Each item in 
\code{rowC} must be named after the columns on which the constrain 
apply. The (vector of) value(s) of each items are the possible values 
that can be retrieved. Values can be character or numeric. If NULL 
(the default), all values are returned.}
  \item{sCol}{Either (1) a vector of character strings with the name of the 
columns to retrieve or (2) a vector of logical of the same 
length as the number of columns or (3) a vector of indexes / 
integers giving the indexes of the column to retrieve. If 
negative, then it indicates the indexes of the column to leave 
out.}
  \item{sRowOp}{A single character string. Operator to be used to combine multiple 
constrains in sRow. Possible values are "OR" or "AND". Default value 
is "AND".}
  \item{formatCol}{If not NULL, a named list of functions to be applied to certain columns 
after the data has been extracted from the database. The name of each list 
item gives the column to process, and the value of each item gives the 
function that must be applied. For instance 
formatCol = list("DATE"=as.Date) will apply the function 
\link{as.Date} to the column "DATE".}
  \item{testFiles}{Single logical. Should the function test for the presence 
(file.exist()) of the needed files in the folder before trying 
to fetch information from the database? }
  \item{verbose}{Single logical. If TRUE, information on what is done are output 
on screen.}
  \item{\dots}{Additional parameters to be passed to \code{dbGetQuery}.}
